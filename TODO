tests: api._request, wrapper, play gui
show info on success/on error
logout
show mixes better way
when mix is playing - show only this mix info
do it with tabs: mixes, current, search
minimalistic UI
logging
show that we are waiting for smth
refactor maybe
think about thread stopping right
errbacks? dont think that we should implement this (find some suitable lib)
there is BUG with phonon-backend-vlc: tracks from queue dont play
make track not seekable or make it working (on mac it works(QuickTime player backend))
preload next track after mix finished
catch hotkeys
load more mixes on scroll
search by tags (with autocomplete)
catch errors in wrapper
close main window on login window close
